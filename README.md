# Hi, I'm Xavier 👋

## About Me
Western Computer Science graduate (Class of 2024) with a passion for new technologies and optimization algorithms. My research interests surround image compression, large language models, and evolutionary algorithms. I thrive on solving complex problems through innovative computational approaches.

## Research Interests
- 🖼️ **Image Compression**: Advanced lossless compression techniques; developed W-OP8, a weighted optimization approach for JPEG XL that achieved up to 2.98% compression improvement
- 🧠 **Large Language Models**: Application based research, working on a project over the summer .
- 🧬 **Evolutionary Algorithms**: New interest and potential masters area. 
- 💻 **Software Engineering**: Building robust, efficient systems with clean architectures

## Featured Project: JPEG XL Predictor Optimization
My thesis research expanded JPEG XL's lossless compression capabilities through predictor optimization:
- 🔍 Developed W-OP8: an optimized implementation that expands JPEG XL's Weighted Average Predictor from 4 to 8 sub-predictors
- 🧪 Applied genetic algorithms to discover optimal predictor weight configurations
- 📊 Achieved compression improvements of 0.64-2.98% across diverse image datasets
- 🏆 Most effective for medical ultrasound images (2.44% avg improvement) and document images (2.56%)



## Current Work
I'm currently exploring the JPEG XL lossless image compression, and will be starting a project on document claim validation this summer!  Always open to collaboration on interesting projects!
